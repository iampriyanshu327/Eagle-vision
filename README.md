# **AI-Powered CCTV Crime Detection with Blockchain-Based Tamper-Proof Investigation System**

## **Overview**
This innovative project aims to revolutionize modern surveillance and forensic investigation systems by combining artificial intelligence with the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology. The system uses AI-powered CCTV to detect suspicious and criminal activities in real-time, while blockchain ensures secure, tamper-proof logging and investigation of reported crimes. Our approach not only improves public safety but also introduces an advanced framework for legal transparency and evidence integrity.

## **Key Features**

### **1. AI-Powered CCTV Surveillance**
- **Real-Time Crime Detection**: Our system uses advanced object detection models and computer vision techniques to recognize violent behaviors, detect weapons, and identify unauthorized access across surveillance zones.
- **Prompt-Based Video Querying**: Law enforcement officers can interact with the system using natural language queries, such as ‚Äúman in a red shirt holding a weapon‚Äù or ‚Äúsuspicious movement around ATM at midnight,‚Äù to retrieve relevant video clips efficiently.

### **2. Blockchain-Based Crime Investigation**
- **Tamper-Proof Smart Contracts**: Every detected crime event automatically triggers a smart contract on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. This contract logs essential case metadata, including:
  - Unique Case ID  
  - Timestamp of the incident  
  - Geolocation  
  - Cryptographic hash of the video evidence  
- **Decentralized Storage via IPFS**: The original surveillance footage is securely stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), guaranteeing immutability and protection against unauthorized modification or deletion.

### **3. Secure Case Management**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to case data is strictly regulated based on user roles. Only verified officials, such as law enforcement agents, forensic investigators, or legal personnel, can view, edit, or add details.
- **Advanced Query Interface**: An intuitive web interface allows investigators to search case histories, analyze video evidence, and append findings or updates to ongoing investigations.

### **4. Legal Verifiability and Transparency**
- **NFT-Based Case Filing**: Each unique case is minted as a **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** and submitted as a digital legal document. These NFTs serve as verifiable, time-stamped case files admissible in court.
- **Immutable Evidence Preservation**: By storing metadata on blockchain and actual video evidence on IPFS, the system ensures transparent and tamper-resistant legal proceedings.

## **Technology Stack**
- **AI & Computer Vision**: Trained object detection models for identifying weapons, violent behavior, and unusual activities.
- **Mistral AI**: Used for intelligent prompt interpretation and response generation in the querying system.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Sepolia testnet for smart contract execution and case metadata storage.
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: Secure, decentralized storage for raw video evidence.
- **Vite.js**: High-performance front-end build tool and development environment for a responsive web interface.
- **Web Interface**: Enables real-time monitoring, incident search, and secure case data access.
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines and monitoring tools for efficient development and updates.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Multi-Camera Real-Time Synchronization**: Expand the system to synchronize data and footage from multiple CCTV sources across different locations.
- **Edge AI Integration**: Deploy AI inference capabilities directly to edge devices (e.g., smart cameras) to minimize latency and reduce server load.
- **Law Enforcement Database Integration**: Enable seamless connection with government databases for quicker background checks and identity verification during case analysis.
